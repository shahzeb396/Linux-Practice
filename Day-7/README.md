# 🌍 Day 7 – Services, Scripting & Automation with Cron in Linux ⚡

Today I explored some of the most powerful Linux concepts that every DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and SysAdmin uses daily in production environments.

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- Service Management: `systemctl`, `service` → starting, stopping, enabling, monitoring services like SSH, Nginx, Docker, Kubernetes agents  
- Shell Scripting: `if`, `for`, `functions` → automating repetitive tasks  
- Cron Jobs: `crontab`, `systemctl status cron` → scheduled tasks (backups, log cleanup, monitoring, deployments)

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Checked and restarted the SSH service  
2. Wrote a `hello.sh` script that prints “Hello DevOps”  
3. Added an if condition to check if `/etc/passwd` exists  
4. Created a for loop to print numbers 1–5  
5. Scheduled a cron job to run `hello.sh` every minute and logged its output  

## 💡 Why it matters:
- Ensures critical services (Nginx, SSH, Docker, K8s) are always running  
- Automates server management with Bash scripts  
- Schedules tasks like backups, deployments, monitoring without human intervention  

Mastering services, scripting, and cron is a huge step toward becoming a Cloud & DevOps Engineer 🚀
