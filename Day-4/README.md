# 💻 Day 4 – Linux Commands: Packages & Editors

Today I continued my DevOps journey by practicing essential Linux package management and text editor commands. 🚀

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- Package management: `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt upgrade`, `apt install`, `apt remove`, `apt search`, `apt show`
- Verifying packages: `dpkg -l | grep nginx`
- Text editors: `nano`, `vi`, `vim`
- Saving & quitting in Vim: `:wq`, exiting without saving: `:q!`

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Updated Ubuntu packages and installed `nginx` web server
2. Removed `nginx` and verified removal using `dpkg -l`
3. Opened a file with nano, wrote “DevOps Practice”, saved & exited
4. Edited a file with vim, wrote text, saved & quit
5. Practiced exiting vim without saving changes

## 💡 Why it matters:
Package management ensures smooth installation, updates, and removal of software.  
Text editors are critical for editing configuration files in servers, Docker containers, and CI/CD pipelines.
