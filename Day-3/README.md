# 💻 Day 3 – Linux Commands: Processes & System Monitoring

Today I continued my DevOps journey by learning and practicing key Linux commands for monitoring processes, system performance, and hardware resources. 🚀

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- Process monitoring: `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`, `kill -9`
- System performance: `uptime`, `free -h`, `df -h`, `du -sh`, `vmstat`, `iostat`
- User activity: `who`, `w`
- System details: `uname -a`, `hostname`, `uptime -p`
- Extra hardware insights: `lscpu`, `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, `mount`, `umount`

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Checked the top 10 running processes using `ps aux | head`
2. Monitored memory usage with `free -h`
3. Viewed CPU & disk stats using `iostat`
4. Created a test process (`sleep 1000`) and killed it with `kill -9 PID`
5. Verified logged-in users using `who` and `w`

## 💡 Why it matters:
Monitoring and managing processes is critical for Linux administration, cloud servers, and containerized environments.
