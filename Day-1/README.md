# 🚀 Day 1 – Linux Commands: Files & Directories

Today I started my DevOps journey by practicing the 20 most important Linux commands for files and directories management. Hands-on practice is the best way to learn! 🖥️

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- Basic navigation: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
- Files & folders: `touch`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`
- File viewing: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
- Copy & move: `cp`, `mv`

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Created a directory `devops_day1` with 3 files: `a.txt`, `b.txt`, `c.txt`
2. Wrote text in `a.txt` and copied it to `b.txt`
3. Moved `c.txt` to `/tmp` folder
4. Displayed last 5 lines of `/var/log/syslog`
5. Created a backup folder and copied all `.txt` files into it

## 💡 Why it matters?
Linux is the foundation of DevOps, Cloud, and System Administration.  
Day by day, I am building skills that will help me in automation, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure management.
