# 💻 Day 2 – Linux Commands: Users, Groups & Permissions

Today I continued my DevOps journey by mastering essential Linux commands for users, groups, and permissions. 🖥️

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- User info & management: `whoami`, `who`, `id`, `groups`
- Creating & managing users: `adduser`, `passwd`, `deluser`
- Creating & managing groups: `groupadd`, `usermod -aG`
- Permissions & ownership: `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, `ls -l`

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Created a new user `intern` and set a password  
2. Created a group `devteam` and added `intern` into it  
3. Made a file `script.sh` and gave execute permission only to owner  
4. Changed owner of `script.sh` to `intern:devteam`  
5. Switched to `intern` user and verified with `whoami`  

## 💡 Why it matters:
Managing users, groups, and permissions is critical for Linux administration, cloud infrastructure security, and DevOps automation.
