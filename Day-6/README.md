# 🌍 Day 6 – Linux Commands: Pipes, Redirects & Text Processing

Today I explored some of the most practical Linux skills that every DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and SysAdmin uses daily. 🚀

## ✅ What I learned & practiced:
- Pipes & Redirects: `>`, `>>`, `|`, `tee`
- Text Processing: `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `cut`
- Archiving & Compression: `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`, `rsync`
- Environment Variables: `export`, `echo`, `printenv`, `unset`

## 📝 Tasks I completed:
1. Created files and searched with `grep`
2. Counted lines using `wc -l`
3. Archived & extracted folders with `tar`
4. Set and unset environment variables
5. Used `rsync` to sync a folder into `/tmp/backup/`

## 💡 Why it matters:
These Linux commands are building blocks for:  
- Monitoring & troubleshooting servers  
- Automating CI/CD pipelines  
- Handling application configs & secrets  
- Performing backups & deployments
